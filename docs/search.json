Then they broke down the results of the poll into one definitive list. But BBC Music didn’t just publish a best-of list, they also published the complete poll results and a description of the simple algorithm they ranked the songs with. - Simon Jockers We awarded 10 points for first ranked track, eight points for second ranked track, and so on down to two points for fifth place. The song with the most points won. We split ties by the total number of votes: songs with more votes ranked higher. Any ties remaining after this were split by first place votes, followed by second place votes and so on: songs with more critics placing them at higher up the lists up ranked higher. -- BBC Music\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# Load packages\n#devtools::install_github(\"thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR\")\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(RcppRoll)\n# Load data\ntt_data <- tt_load(2020, week = 16)\n\n\n\n    Downloading file 1 of 2: `polls.csv`\n    Downloading file 2 of 2: `rankings.csv`\n\n\nShow the code\nartist_polls <- tt_data$polls\nartist_rankings <- tt_data$rankings"

His journey as a music enthusiast began at just 12-years-old making beats and djing for family parties. Inspired by Skrillex and Deadmau5, his taste at first geared toward EDM electronic beats. His sound would go through a series of changes, moving into the Hip-Hop/Trap scene in LA producing beats and creating mixes for local artists in his area of Los Angeles. Inferno has performed and opened up for big and small names in LA. A very active member of his local community, Inferno is no stranger to the ups-and-downs of the music scene.  Though he loves playing at parties, patios and private events, his love for music goes beyond the spectrum of mixing tunes.
