His journey as a music enthusiast began at just 12-years-old making beats and djing for family parties. Inspired by Skrillex and Deadmau5, his taste at first geared toward EDM electronic beats.

Inferno has performed and opened up for big and small names in LA. A very active member of his local community, Inferno is no stranger to the ups-and-downs of the music scene.Â  Though he loves playing at parties, patios and private events, his love for music goes beyond the spectrum of mixing tunes.
